This project cleans and transforms the United Nations immigration dataset, originally provided in a wide format with years as columns and regions as rows, along with metadata and missing values. The notebook loads the data from Google Sheets, skips unnecessary metadata rows, assigns proper column names, and cleans missing or placeholder values. It then converts the dataset from wide to long format using pandas melt(), resulting in columns for Type, Coverage, AreaName, RegName, Year, and Count. The final tidy dataset is ready for analysis and visualization, allowing examination of migration trends across regions and over time, and is also saved as a CSV for future use.
